meta-description: "This blog was built using Jekyll, Markdown, Liquid, Linux, Lecton, Molengo, Alegreya, Vim, and the Linux command line"
---

This blog was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) --- a static site generator that converts text files written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to <span class="sc">html</span>, which is then formatted using a combination of <span class="sc">css</span> and [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) templates.  

The typography on the site uses a combination of [Lekton](http://www.lekton.info/) (designed by <span class="sc">isia</span> Urbino), [Molengo](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/foundry/Denis-Jacquerye) (designed by Denis Jacquerye), and [Alegreya](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya) (designed by Juan Pablo del Peral).

The theme for this site, and the basis of the language above describing the tools and fonts used to build it, are by <a href = "http://stephenramsay.us/">Stephen Ramsay</a>. The technically inclined can fork Stephen Ramsay's original site, upon which this was based, on [GitHub](https://github.com/sramsay/sramsay.github.com).
