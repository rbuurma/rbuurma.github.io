Please join us on Thursday, November 20th at 5:15 pm for the second seminar in our year-long series on nineteenth-century knowledge organization practices and information culture:  

<span class="sc">Richard Menke</span> on “Touchstones and Tit-Bits:Extracting Culture in the 1880s.”

How should print culture respond to a modern explosion of new sources of information and new modes of reading? In the 1880s, the answer seemed to lie in excerpting—from Matthew Arnold’s exalted poetic “touchstones” to George Newnes’s enthusiastically commonplace weekly newspaper Tit-Bits. The touchstone and the tit-bit turn older practices of excerpting into self-conscious ruling principles. Furthermore, the poetics of the cultural snippet shapes Arnold’s criticism and Newnes’s journalism in profound and peculiar ways. Reading touchstones alongside Tit-Bits suggests how a broader view of print cultures might enrich our sense of the history of literary theory, form, and value.
