Rather than seeing the digital archive as an inferior surrogate of the material original, this talk argues for a new understanding of the materiality of digital objects. The digital archive Livingstone Online recovers David Livingstone's faded, crumbling field diaries using spectral imaging, a technique that renders these images more legible than the originals - making them, in some ways, more material than the materials.


Megan Ward is assistant professor of English at Oregon State University and Associate Director of the NEH-funded digital archive Livingstone Online. Her work on realism and technology has appeared in <i>SEL</i>, <i>Configurations</i>, and <i>Victorian Periodicals Review</i>.
