<b>Simon Reader’s “ ‘Queer Little Experiences’: George Gissing’s Notes”</b>

<b>with a response by Patrick Keilty</b>

Simon’s paper explores George Gissing's investment in minimal acts of documentation, both in his Commonplace Book and in his published works. Notes offer Gissing a way of staying tethered to life amid decaying ethical ideals, if only in the drift of the present that may not be headed anywhere and that may not add up to anything.

He completed his PhD in English and Sexual Diversity Studies at the University of Toronto earlier this year. His current book project, Note for Note: The Aesthetics of Inquiry, argues for the coherence of the notebook as a genre, drawing on an eclectic group of writers from the late-eighteenth to the early twentieth century.
