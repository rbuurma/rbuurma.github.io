Cleanth Brooks, Modern Poetry (Fall Term syllabus for English 71, 1963-Spring 1964, Yale)

Brooks begins his fall term Modern Poetry syllabus with  month on the premoderns: he covers “Three Transitional Poets” (Hardy, Housman, and Hopkins) then A.E. and Yeats help him transition to “radical modernity.”  A brief critical interlude in October covers “Five Modern Critics”: T.E. Hulme, Edgell Rickword, Stephen Spender, T.S. Eliot, and RP. Warren, all included in Robert Stallman’s *Critiques and Essays in Criticism*. (The Yale course guide warns prospective students that these essays structure the final exam.) After quizzing the students on these critical essays, Brooks turns to poems by Amy Lowell, H.D. Fletcher, D.H. Lawrence, Edgar Lee Masters, Carl Sandburg, Vachel Lindsay, Edwin R. Robinson, Robert Frost, John Masefield, Rupert Brooke, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and Wallace Stevens, emphasis on Frost, Eliot, and Stevens.  Students wrote papers through the term on Hardy or Housman, Yeats, Frost, Eliot, and Stevens.

From the *Yale Course Critique*, 1963, p 28:
> The informal approach of Cleanth Brooks is perhaps the most unique feature of English 71. Although Mr. Brooks usually lectures for most of the period, questions from the (small) class are welcome and frequently forthcoming. "Digressions" often ensue which many times form the most interesting and valuable part of the class period. Few students take notes.
